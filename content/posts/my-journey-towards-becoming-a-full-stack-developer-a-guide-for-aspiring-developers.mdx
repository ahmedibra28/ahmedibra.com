Hi there! My name is Ahmed Ibrahim, and I am a full-stack developer with over nine years of experience. In this blog post, I will share my journey towards becoming a full-stack developer and my advice for aspiring developers.

**Background**

I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Plasma University in 2026. Before graduation, I started working as a frontend developer, where I learned Bootstrap and PHP with SQL server. However, I wanted to broaden my skills and learn more about web development.

**Journey**

I started learning Python and the Django web framework. This led me to JavaScript, where I mastered Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. I also explored Next.js for frontend and backend development with MongoDB. To build mobile apps, I learned React Native. Along the way, I delved into cloud hosting with platforms like AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Linode, and more.

**Advice**

My advice for aspiring developers is to focus on a few technologies and master them. I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. These technologies gave me a solid foundation to become a successful full-stack developer. Don't waste time jumping from one technology to another. Instead, focus on specific technologies to become an expert.

**Projects**

I have worked with various clients, including Yardimeli and Wadaag. Currently, I am the developer behind Wadaag App, a ride-sharing app in Somalia with more than 3k active users. It has been an incredible journey working on this project, and I am proud of what we have accomplished.

**Conclusion**

Becoming a full-stack developer takes time, dedication, and patience. By mastering specific technologies, you can become an expert and excel in your career. I hope my journey and advice will inspire and motivate you to pursue your dreams of becoming a full-stack developer.

Thank you for reading!
